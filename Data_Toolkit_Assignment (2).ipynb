        "1. NumPy is a fundamental library in Python for scientific computing. It offers powerful features for working with multidimensional arrays and performing various mathematical operations efficiently. It is widely used because it is an is an open source Python library that has a wide range of inbuilt functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Broadcasting is a mechanism in NumPy that allows performing operations on arrays of different shapes under certain conditions. When operands have different shapes, NumPy expands the smaller array to match the larger one in a specific way to perform element-wise operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A Pandas DataFrame is one of the core data structures provided by the Pandas library in Python. It is used for storing, manipulating, and analyzing tabular data (data arranged in rows and columns), similar to an Excel spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The groupby() method in Pandas is used to split data into groups, apply some operation on each group, and then combine the results. It is extremely useful for data analysis, especially when summarizing or aggregating data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The steps are as follows:-\n",
        "\n",
        "   Split - divide the DataFrame into groups based on some column(s)\n",
        "\n",
        "   Apply - perform an operation (sum, mean, count, max, min, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "   Combine - merge the results back into a new DataFrame\n",
        "\n",
        "This is known as the Split-Apply-Combine process.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Seaborn is preferred for statistical visualizations in Python because it is built specifically to make statistical plotting simpler, more attractive, and more powerful than using Matplotlib alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Python lists and NumPy arrays are both used to store collections of data, but they differ significantly in their characteristics and use cases.\n",

        "  \n",
        "  Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python List: Less memory efficient, especially for large datasets, as each element is a full Python object with its own type information and reference count.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy Array: More memory efficient for large numerical datasets because it stores data in contiguous memory blocks and avoids the overhead of individual Python objects for each element.\n",
